## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please use issues with the tag *vulnerability*.
The report will be quickly checked, as I ((ColeXander)[https://github.com/ColeXander]) work on this project often, the max you can expect is a week.
The amount of time it will take to have the bug fixed can be a good while, as it is hard to recode some projects as their unpackaged file no longer exists.
